        <p>was born and brought up in the family of Sanskrit scholars and Vedic pundits. Swamiji's father Late Sri Sheshabhattar Sundaracharya Deshikar was a renowned scholar in Sanskrit who won the Rashtrapathi Award, a Vedic scholar of repute. </p>
        <p>Swamiji mastered Sanskrit at an early age, which helped him in understanding ancient scripts thoroughly.He was a brilliant student who also excelled in sports.At the age of 14, while he was still in school, the tragic death of his beloved grandfather, Late Sri Sheshabhattar Ramacharya Deshikar, proved to be the turning point in his life and his restless mind craved for an answer to the mysteries of life and death. </p>
<p>He left his home in the search of answers to these mysteries. He travelled throughout the country and met many seers in Rishikesh, at the foothills of the Himalayas but could not get satisfactory answers over there. At that time Swamiji met H.H. Sri Devaraha Baba at Brindavan Ashram who taught him hidden secrets of Pranayama and kundalini Yoga. He then travelled to Nepal and Tibet. In Lhasa, he met a Buddhist monk Vang Kaung, who taught him the ancient secrets of Tibetan medicine and Himalayan herbal therapy for two years. </p>

<p>After two long years of meticulous learning Swamiji continued his journey in search of answers. On his way of continued journey, Swamiji was struck with and amazing sight in the middle of the thick forest. A gigantic Naked Yeti (Himalayan sanyasi) was in a deep meditation. Swamiji stood by a small waterfall awaiting Yeti sanyasi. A few hours later, the Yeti sanyasi emerged from his meditation and saw Swamiji standing by a waterfall. </p>
<p>Yeti sanyasi recognized the yogic powers of Swamiji and took him to his cave, where they lived together for about seven years. The Yeti taught him hidden secrets of Prananyama and Herbals. After many years of devoted service, he learnt Pranayama, Brahma Vidya, Kundalini Shakthi (coiled energy) and many other unrevealed secret treasures of wisdom from this super- human being, Swamiji returned home after a decade and de- cided to devote himself to the service of mankind.</p>
